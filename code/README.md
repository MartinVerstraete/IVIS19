Small Guide to how to set up github repo on your computer so you can access our cool stuff.
use the terminal! That's what I know at least...

Create a directory where you want to keep the project (eg CoolProject)
go there in terminal, (in linux  cd CoolProject)
write(sorry had to remove FikaAndTurkish for the website sake!)

git clone https://github.com/username/emmabru.github.io/

Done! you should have all code from the git on your computer

Add things to the git! --------
make sure you are in your directory, eg CoolProject
git add *   
git commit -m "meaningful message to my team"   
git push

***it will tell you to write username and password****

First row means you want to add all files in that directory, to the git.
Second row, this is like a checkpoint in a game, when you make a commit, you can come back to it later. GREAT THING, add and commit as soon as you've accomplished anything! You also add a message so you know what each commit means. Eg "heatmap is working", "heatmap with colors for Sweden and Finland is working"

Get thing from the git!---------------------
Someone else pushed things to the git, so you want to update your version!
git pull

you will most likely have merge conflicts. This means that your code looks different as some places, maybe you both edited the index.html file. You can solve them in your texteditor, we'll take when the time comes.

PS you can also use the GUI, that is the github website, if the terminal and such confuses you!
